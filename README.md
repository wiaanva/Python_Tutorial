# Python_Tutorial
Repository for my Python tutorial on Microsoft Docs using Visual Studio 2019. 

HUGE learning curve here.  So much to do so I am jumping around a bit.  

My end goal is to have a web app that provides input for any word, which is then passed to a database to return matching words using proprietary logic.  To achieve this goal the solution will have to include a database project that I can use as source code to deploy and track changes.

So whilst I did this I started a few online courses and they use different languages:
1. Shaw Academy Computer Science uses C.
2. I was told Python is a good start (Easy to learn)
3. I need to learn about classes, models and so on (OOP) so I have a linkedin learing course for that.  which I assume will be done in ASP.Net C#.

So there we have it... For now I am sticking to Python.  Once I have a web app with DB project I will move onto the logic and then write the same thing in ASP.net.
